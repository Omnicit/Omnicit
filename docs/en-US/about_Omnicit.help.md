## about_Omnicit

# SHORT DESCRIPTION
Omnicit is a toolbox module for PowerShell. It contains a set of small to large functions to help with administrative tasks and data transformation.

# LONG DESCRIPTION
The Omnicit PowerShell Toolbox (OPT) will help with everyday tasks when managing various Microsoft systems and services.

As of now the module is not split up in different subareas or prefixes. If there is any request for this, we'll probably implement some sort of subarea, prefix or child modules.
